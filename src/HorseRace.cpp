/*ideas:

	use line of best fit algorithm from
	https://github.com/antkowiak/LineOfBestFit/blob/master/lobf.cpp
	to find the line of best fit from the immediate points in like a 2 radius
	and extract a normal vector from that

	to distinguish points that are at the edge, only add the points (black)
	that are next to white points to the list of points which
	will be used to find the line of best fit.
